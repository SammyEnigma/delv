## A working taskbar replacement, mimicking the Windows 10 taskbar down to the acrylic.

<p align="center"><img src="preview.png"></p<br>
<h3>(No, it's not UWP!)</h3>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Supports Acrylic on supported versions of Windows 10 (FCU onwards)</b>
<li>Functional buttons (Start,Search,Cortana,Timeline/Task View,Network,Whiteboard,Clock,Action Center,Peek Desktop,Sound,Input Selector)
<li>The wifi signal indicator actually does its job.
<li>The sound button imitates the actual thing completely, and shows up the volume flyout when clicked. However - the taskbar may momentarily glitch while doing so.
<li>Manages open windows (like the normal taskbar)
<li>Can launch apps and bring apps to front
<li>Displays your pinned apps and can launch them
<li>Emulates the real thing as close as possible
<li>Hides your actual taskbar (literally, this is not like "auto hide taskbar" - if you dont exit the app properly,<br>your taskbar wont come back on its own!)
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Don't try to count them there are lots</i></b>
<li>Its.. umm.. <b>s l o w</b>
<li>UWP apps <strike>sometimes do not show up</strike>, and are not pinned. (You can pin a shortcut of the UWP app, however, and won't notice any difference)
<li> icons of running UWP apps do not show up.
</ul>
